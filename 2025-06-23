Generative AI
  Generative AI is built by using supervised learning to repeatedly predict the next word. 
  When we train a very large AI system on a lot of data, we get a large language model like ChatGPT.
  
Supervised Learning-based AI: 
  Get labeled data  -> Train AI model on data -> Deploy model (find a cloud service to run it robustly)  ---  6 months
Prompt-based AI:
  Specify prompt --> Deploy model (to the cloud)  --- a week

Supervised Learning Application is still the mainstream.
Generative AI is promising. -  Create more opportunities.
Unsupervised Learning is ok.
Reinforcement Learning is developing but don't have enough commercial values.

The value of AI concentrated in certian areas, such as comsumer software internet and Tech.
  Small-budget projects can leverage AI to build customized low-code or no-code solutions. Users do this by providing prompts/Data instead of writing code.
