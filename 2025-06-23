Generative AI
  Generative AI is built by using supervised learning to repeatedly predict the next word. 
  When we train a very large AI system on a lot of data, we get a large language model like ChatGPT.
  
Supervised Learning-based AI: 
  Get labeled data  -> Train AI model on data -> Deploy model (find a cloud service to run it robustly)  ---  6 months
Prompt-based AI:
  Specify prompt --> Deploy model (to the cloud)  --- a week

Supervised Learning Application is still the mainstream.
Generative AI is promising. -  Create more opportunities.
Unsupervised Learning is ok.
Reinforcement Learning is developing but doesn't have enough commercial value.

The value of AI has been concentrated in specific areas, such as consumer software, the internet, and technology.
  Small-budget projects can leverage AI to build customized low-code or no-code solutions. Users do this by providing prompts/Data instead of writing code.

StartUp 
  -> Idea: 
      * Can be validated efficiently
      * Gives clear direction to execute
      * Often from a subject matter expert who's deeply thought about a problem
  -> Validate(Market& technical validation) 
  -> Recruit CEO(recruit CEO to build with us) 
  -> Build with CEO (deep customer and technical validation/ BUild prototype)
  -> Pre-seed growth $1M pre-seed. hire key executives, build MVP, Get early customer traction)
  -> Seed, Growth, Scale
